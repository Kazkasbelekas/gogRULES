## The Dual Reference System

In these rules, we use a dual reference system:

* **The section number (§)**, such as **§11.2.6**, indicates the rule's specific location within this document. Use this for reading the rules in order or finding a topic in the table of contents.
* **The short CODE**, such as **MAG.60**, is a stable identifier for a specific game event. This code is used on unit cards, in the app, and for quick reference during gameplay, as it will never change even if the rulebook layout is updated.
* This is a simple Test

## Rules Interpretation

To ensure a fair and consistent experience, all rules in Gloom of Gods are governed by a few fundamental principles.

### The Golden Rule: Rules Hierarchy

The most important principle is that a specific rule always overrides a general one. If rules seem to contradict each other, their precedence is resolved in the following order, from highest to lowest authority:

1. **Scenario Rules:** [<kbd><mark style="color:$success;">These have the<mark style="color:$success;"></kbd>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] highest authority and override all other rules.
2. [Attack](../part-i-core-engine/2-the-unit-profile.md#wound-n.-game-term-the-specific-unit-of-damage.-a-unit-suffers-one-wound-for-each-uncanceled-hit-it) Test [Active Player](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vFqeg0Tp1r7fZtXXNCvj/#active-player "mention")
