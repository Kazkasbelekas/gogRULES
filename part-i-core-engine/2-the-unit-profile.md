### Attack Test&#x20;

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Step ATC.10 Roll**

Both players gather their dice pools and roll them simultaneously.

* Attacker: Always rolls their full dice pool as indicated by the attack's profile (e.g., both 🟥Attack Dice and 🟦Defense Dice from their statline).
* Defender:
* In a Melee Attack Action: Rolls their full 🛡️Defense (D) characteristic (both 🟥 and 🟦 dice).
* In a Ranged Attack: Rolls only the 🟦Defense Dice from their 🛡️Defense (D) characteristic.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Step ATC.20 → Reroll**


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Step ATC.30 → Criticals**


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Step ATC.40→ Cancel**

The number of successful strikes is now determined.

* Each 🛡️Block result from the Defender cancels one ⚔️Hit result from the Attacker.
* In Melee Attack Action: Each 🛡️Block result from the Attacker cancels one ⚔️Hit result from the Defender.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Step ATC.50→ Inflict**

All remaining, uncancelled ⚔️Hits are converted into 🩸Wounds.

* For each uncancelled ⚔️Hit the Attacker has, the Defender's unit suffers 1 🩸Wound.
* In Melee Attack Action: For each uncancelled ⚔️Hit the Defender has, the Attacker's unit suffers 1 🩸Wound.
